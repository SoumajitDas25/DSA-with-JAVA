# **Insertion Sort Algorithm**
- ### _The Array is divided into 2 parts: Sorted & Unsorted_
- ### _In every ith-iteration, every element in the unsorted part is taken & is compared to the elements before it in the sorted part & is placed to its correct postion in the sorted part._
- ### _It is an in-place algorithm._
- ### _It is a stable sort algorithm (i.e.,relative order of duplicate elements remains same in the final sorted array)._

## **Complexity Analysis**

- ### Time Complexity 
    |Best Case|Average Case|Worst Case|
    |-|-|-|
    |Ω(n)|Θ(n^2)|O(n^2)|

- ### Space Complexity: O(1)
