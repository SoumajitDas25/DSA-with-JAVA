# **Selection Sort Algorithm**
- ### _The Array is divided into 2 parts: Sorted & Unsorted_
- ### _In every ith-iteration, the minimum element in the unsorted part is selected & is placed to its correct postion in the sorted part._
- ### _It is an in-place algorithm._
- ### _It is an unstable sort algorithm (i.e.,relative order of duplicate elements does not always remains same in the final sorted array)._
